# Computer Systems Fundamentals COMP1521 2022 Term 2

## Course Summary

This course introduces students to how computer systems are structured in terms of basic electronic components, how they are used to implement procedural programs, and how they are structured as a collection of software layers. It introduces students to low-level software layers such as operating systems, and introduces concurrency concepts. The goal is to give students a solid understanding of what happens when high-level programs are executed, as a basis for further study in important areas of computing such as computer architecture, operating systems.

## Assumed Knowledge

Before commencing this course, students should be able to:

- write simple programs in the C programming language
- define and invoke functions and return results in C
- define and manipulate structured data in C
- use pointers to access data objects

These are assumed to have been acquired in COMP1511 or COMP1911.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this course, students will be able to:

- Describe the architectural layers (fundamental parts) of a modern computer systems from hardware device (chip) levels upwards
- Describe the principles of memory management and explain the workings of a system with virtual memory management
- Explain how the major components of a CPU work together, including how data and instructions are represented in a computer
- Design, implement, and analyse small programs at the assembly/machine level
- Describe the relationship between a high-level procedural language (C) and assembly (machine language) which implements it, including how a compiled program is executed in a classical von Neumann machine
- Explain how input/output operations are implemented, and describe some basic I/O devices
- Describe the components comprising, and the services offered by, an operating system
- Implement simple programs involving communication and concurrency

## Assignments

There are two assessable programming assignments. Assignments give you the chance to practice what you have learnt on relatively large problems (compared to the small exercises in the labs). Assignments are a very important part of this course, therefore it is essential that you attempt them yourself.

- Assignment 1, on Assembly programming (MIPS); due Friday Week 5; worth 15%
- Assignment 2, on System programming; due Monday Week 10; worth 15%

Late assignments submissions will be penalised. The exact penalty will be the standard UNSW late penalty of a mark reduction equal to 5% of the achieved (raw) assessment mark per day late, or a zero mark after 5 days (i.e. 120 hours).
